fun fact 2:The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of
 pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins.[21][22] Popular modern customs of the holiday
  include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; 
  watching Christmas movies; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church services;
   a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, 
   Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several
    closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint
     Nicholas, and the Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas
      season and have their own body of traditions and lore.[23] Because gift-giving and many other 
      aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become 
      a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few
       centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.
